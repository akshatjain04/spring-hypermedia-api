# Spring Hypermedia API

The Spring Hypermedia API is a github repository serves as a sample project designed to illustrate the process of using RoostGPT (an AI-powered tool) which streamlines the mechanism of creating test cases, enabling developers to improve code quality and accelerate development workflows.

## Overview

The Spring Hypermedia API demonstrates the significance of thorough unit testing in Java projects, particularly within the Spring framework. By prioritizing unit tests, this project aims to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionalities.

## Development Process

The development process of the Spring Hypermedia API integrates cutting-edge AI-powered tools, notably RoostGPT, alongside established practices:

1. **Code Implementation:**  
   Java code is implemented following Spring framework conventions, with an emphasis on RESTful APIs and hypermedia-driven designs.

2. **Test Generation with RoostGPT:**  
   RoostGPT, an AI-powered test generator, is utilized to automate the generation of comprehensive unit tests. This innovative approach enhances test coverage and efficiency in the development process.

3. **Test Execution:**  
   Maven is used as the build automation tool to compile the code and execute AI-generated unit tests. This ensures thorough validation of the application's functionality.

## Running Maven Tests

To run Maven tests for the Spring Hypermedia API project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roost-io/spring-hypermedia-api.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd spring-hypermedia-api
   ```

3. **Build the project using Maven:**
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

4. **Run the unit tests:**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

   This command executes all unit tests defined within the project, providing feedback on test results and code coverage.

5. **(Optional) Run Specific Tests:**  
   If you want to run specific test classes or methods, you can use Maven's Surefire plugin to filter tests. Use the following command format:

   - To run a specific test class:
     ```bash
     mvn -Dtest=TestClassName test
     ```

     Replace `TestClassName` with the name of the class containing the tests you want to run.

   - To run a specific test method within a class:
     ```bash
     mvn -Dtest=TestClassName#testMethodName test
     ```

     Replace `testMethodName` with the name of the test method you want to run.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE_470: Unchecked Type Cast
Issue: An unchecked cast was performed in the equals function. The object is directly cast to Cart before additional checks are performed. If this function is called and a non-Cart object is passed, a ClassCastException will be thrown.
Solution: The equals method can be improved with an instanceof check before the cast.

Vulnerability: CWE_476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: If 'books' is null, you are returning false, when 'other.books' is not null. But you are not checking whether 'other.books' is null when 'books' is not null. If 'other' is null 'other.books' will throw a NullPointerException.
Solution: A null check should be performed on 'other.books' before using it in an equals method.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing for Equality of the Same Object Instance 
Details: 
  TestName: testEqualityOfSameObject
  Description: This test is designed to evaluate if the equals method correctly identifies when we're comparing the same instance of an object with itself.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Create an instance of Cart. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the same Cart instance as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation:
    The purpose of the assertion is to verify the equality condition in Java. This condition is significant in the context of defining the equals method; if an object is compared with itself, it should return true.

Scenario 2: Testing for Equality of Two Different, but Identical Objects
  Details: 
    TestName: testEqualityOfTwoIdenticalObjects
    Description: This test is designed to validate whether the equals method correctly identifies when two different but identical instances of Cart are equal.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Create two different Cart instances containing the same list of books and the same purchased status.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the second Cart instance to the first.
      Assert: Assert that the result is true.
    Validation:
      The assertion validates that the equals method successfully recognizes two identical objects. This is important for consistent behavior in applications that rely on object equality.

Scenario 3: Testing for Null Object
  Details: 
    TestName: testEqualityForNullObject
    Description: This test is designed to check that the equals method correctly identifies when an object is compared with a null reference.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Create an instance of Cart.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing a null reference as the argument.
      Assert: Assert that the result is false.
    Validation: 
      The assertion verifies that the equals method identifies null references correctly. This is crucial to avoid NullPointerException in applications.

Scenario 4: Testing for Equality with Different Object Class
  Details: 
    TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentObjectClass
    Description: This test is meant to assert the equals method correctly identifies when an object is compared with an instance from a different class.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Create a Cart instance and an instance from a different class.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the instance from a different class.
      Assert: Assert that the result is false.
    Validation: 
      The assertion verifies the equals method functionality to compare objects of different classes. This is important for proper type checking in Java applications.

Scenario 5: Testing for Equality with Different Purchased Status
  Details: 
    TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentPurchasedStatus
    Description: This test is designed to verify the equals method identifies correctly when two Cart instances with the same books but different purchased statuses are not equal.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Create two Cart instances with the same books list but different purchased statuses.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing as argument the second Cart instance.
      Assert: Assert that the result is false.
    Validation: 
      The assertion verifies if the equals method checks for the identical state of the Cart objects. This is important for applications to distinguish between cart objects based on their purchase status.

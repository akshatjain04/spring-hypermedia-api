  Scenario 1: Test for checking equality when the same object is compared.

  Details:
    TestName: testEqualityInSameObject
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the equals method returns true when comparing the same object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart object and prepare the target conditions.
    Act: Compare the object to itself by invoking the equals method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if true is returned.
  Validation:
    If the same object is provided as a parameter to the equals method, it should always return true denoting the objects are equal. This test ensures to validate this against the equals implementation to confirm its integrity.

  Scenario 2: Test for checking inequality when the given object is null.

  Details:
    TestName: testInequalityInNullObject
    Description: The test checks whether the equals method returns false upon comparing to a null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Cart object and prepare the target conditions.
    Act: Use null as a parameter for the equals method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if false is returned.
  Validation:
    Our equals method, should return false when it is compared to null. This behavior is a basic requirement for an equals method and tests the correct implementation.

  Scenario 3: Test for checking inequality when a different class object is compared.

  Details:
    TestName: testInequalityInDifferentClassObject
    Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared to an object from a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create both Cart and non-Cart objects beforehand.
    Act: Invoke equals method on a Cart by using a non-Cart item as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if false is returned.
  Validation:
    Java's contract for the equals method mandates that it should return false when comparing objects of different classes. This test ensures that the behavior is upheld.

Scenario 4: Test for checking equality when two identical objects are compared.

  Details:
    TestName: testEqualityInIdenticalObjects
    Description: This test validates that the equals method will return true when comparing two similar Cart objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two similar Cart objects with similar books list and purchased value.
    Act: Invoke equals using one cart against the other.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if true is returned.
  Validation:
    If two objects possess identical data, the equals method should return true, signifying that they are indeed equal. This test ensures that the equals method behaves as per expectations when identical objects are compared.

Replace cart.setBooks() call with cart.add(new Book())

ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getBooks_9722ce6c80

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Exposed mutable object
Issue: Directly returning a mutable object reference may lead to unintentional modifications outside of encapsulating class.
Solution: Return a defensive copy of mutable object or make the object immutable.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to ensure method returns all books as expected

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksReturnsAllBooks
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method is correctly returning the entire list of books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with some predefined list of books.
  Act: Invoke getBooks method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is the same as the initialized list.
Validation: 
  Validates that the method correctly returns the list of all books. This is critical for the application to effectively manage and display available books.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure method returns an empty list when no books are available.

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksReturnsEmptyList
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method correctly returns an empty list when there are no books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with zero books.
  Act: Invoke getBooks method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is the same as the initialized list, i.e., empty list.
Validation: 
  Validates that the method correctly handles the scenario where there are no books. This is crucial for handling edge cases in the application and providing accurate information to users.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure the method does not return null.

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksDoesNotReturnNull
  Description: This test checks if the getBooks method does not return null, even if there are no books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list as null.
  Act: Invoke getBooks method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is not null.
Validation: 
  Validates that the method never returns null, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 4: Test for the immutability of the returned list.

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksReturnsImmutableList
  Description: This test checks if modifications to the returned list do not affect the original list in the class. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with some predefined list of books.
  Act: Invoke getBooks method and try to add a new book to the returned list.
  Assert: Assert that the original list of books remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  Validates the immutability of the returned list, ensuring the list's integrity and data consistency within the application.

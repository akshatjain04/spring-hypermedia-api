Scenario 1: Validate Equals method when both Books are identical
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalBooks
  Description: This test is supposed to verify if the equals method works correctly when the two books are identical (i.e., all the attributes are the same for both books).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two books with identical fields (ISBN, author, title).
  Act: Use the equals method to check if the two books are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  In a situation when two books have all identical attributes like ISBN, author, and title, the equals method should return true indicating they are identical. This test validates such scenarios as a part of the book business logic.

Scenario 2: Validate Equals method when comparing with a different class instance
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassInstance
  Description: This test is supposed to check if the equals method correctly identifies that the instance being compared with is not a Book instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object and another object of a different class.
  Act: Compare the book object with the object of a different class using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should acknowledge that two objects are not the same, if they are instances of different classes, hence should return false. This test checks if equal method handles this logic correctly.

Scenario 3: Validate Equals method when comparing two books with different attributes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentBooks
  Description: This test verifies if the equals method works correctly when two books have different authors, titles, or ISBN.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two books with different fields (ISBN, author, title).
  Act: Use the equals method to check if the two books are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The equals method should identify when two Books are different (authors, title, or ISBN is different), hence should return false. This test verifies if the method incorporates this book logic correctly.

Scenario 4: Validate Equals method when book is compared with null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: This test is supposed to check if the equals method works correctly when a book is being compared with a null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book and a null object.
  Act: Compare the book object with null using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  According to the object contract, null should not be equal to any valid object. The test verifies if equals method adheres to this logic.

Scenario 5: Validate Equals method with the same book
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameBook
  Description: This test is meant to confirm if a book is equal to itself when the equals method is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object.
  Act: Compare the book object with itself using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  As per the object contract, an object should be equal to itself. This test checks if the equals method upholds this principle.

  Scenario 1: Verify setTitle method with valid input
  Details:  
    TestName: testSetTitleWithValidInput.
    Description: The test is meant to check if the setTitle method properly sets the title when a valid title is provided as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setTitle method. Define a valid title string.
    Act: Invoke setTitle method with the valid title string as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the title has been set correctly by checking the title field of the object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that when a valid title string is provided, the title of the object is set correctly. It confirms the correct functionality of the setTitle method.

  Scenario 2: Verify setTitle method with null input
  Details:  
    TestName: testSetTitleWithNullInput.
    Description: The test is meant to check how the setTitle method behaves when a null value is provided as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setTitle method. Define a null title string.
    Act: Invoke setTitle method with the null title string as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the title of the object is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that when a null value is passed in, the title of the object is set to null. It checks the behavior of the setTitle method when provided with null values.

  Scenario 3: Verify setTitle method with empty string input
  Details:  
    TestName: testSetTitleWithEmptyInput.
    Description: The test checks how the setTitle method behaves when an empty string is provided as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setTitle method. Define an empty title string.
    Act: Invoke setTitle method with the empty title string as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the title of the object is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when an empty string is passed as a parameter, the title of the object is set as an empty string. It validates the behavior of the setTitle method when provided with empty string inputs.
    
  Scenario 4: Verify setTitle method with very long string input
  Details:  
    TestName: testSetTitleWithLongInput.
    Description: The test checks how the setTitle method behaves when a very long string is provided as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setTitle method. Define a very long title string.
    Act: Invoke setTitle method with the long title string as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the title of the object is the long string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when a very long string is passed as a parameter, the title of the object is set as that long string. It checks the behavior of the setTitle method when provided with long string inputs.

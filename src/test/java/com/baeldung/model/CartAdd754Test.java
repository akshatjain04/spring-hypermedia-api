Scenario 1: Add Book to An Empty List

Details:  
  TestName: testAddBookToEmptyList
  Description: This test case checks whether the bookToAdd has been correctly added to an empty books list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book. 
  Act: Invoke the 'add' method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the books list isn't empty and its first element equals the bookToAdd instance.
Validation:
  We need to ensure that the method handles an empty books list correctly. Upon adding a book, that book should be the only item in the list.

Scenario 2: Add Book to An Non-Empty List

Details:  
  TestName: testAddBookToNonEmptyList
  Description: This test case verifies whether the bookToAdd is added at the end of a non-empty books list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book, add another book to the books list.
  Act: Invoke the 'add' method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert that the books list size has increased and the last element equals the bookToAdd instance.
Validation:
  We need to ensure that bookToAdd is added at the end of the list. When adding a book to the non-empty list, the size of the books list should be increased by 1, and the book should be on the last position.

Scenario 3: Add Null Book

Details:  
  TestName: testAddNullBook
  Description: This test case checks for the handling of a scenario where a null Book is added to the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null to the add method.
  Act: Invoke the 'add' method with null as an argument.
  Assert: Expect a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  The method should not accept a null book. A NullPointerException is expected when a null book is added to the list.
  
Scenario 4: Add Duplicate Book

Details:  
  TestName: testAddDuplicateBook
  Description: This test case checks what happens when the same book is added twice consecutively.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Book, add it to the books list.
  Act: Invoke the 'add' method on the same Book instance twice.
  Assert: Assert that the size of the books list has increased accordingly and that both book instances are in the list.
Validation:
  If the books list allows the addition of duplicate elements, then adding the same book twice should increase the list size by 2.

Scenario 5: Add Book when Purchased

Details:  
  TestName: testAddBookWhenPurchased
  Description: This test case checks whether we can add a book to the list after the purchased flag is set to true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the purchased flag to true, create a Book instance.
  Act: Invoke the 'add' method on the Book instance.
  Assert: Assert if the books list size has increased.
Validation:
  The addition of a book to the list should not depend on the purchased flag, and the book should be added successfully even if the purchased is true.

ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The hashCode() method in the code uses a fixed prime number for calculating hash. Variable 'prime' is fixed and can produce predictable hash values which might be exploited by an attacker for collision attacks.
Solution: Replace the method to generate a secure hash value. Consider using a secure hash function that may provide better resistance against collisions and makes it hard for an attacker to guess the hash.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: Null Pointer Dereference
Issue: There are conditional checks for null before calling hashCode(). However, if any of 'author', 'isbn', or 'title' are null during the execution of the hashCode(), it can lead to Null Pointer Exception.
Solution: Ensure that 'author', 'isbn', or 'title' are never null before they are used. Proper null checks or Optional can be used to prevent null values. 

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code does not seem to be part of any class. If this code is debug code or written for temporary testing, and mistakenly gets into production environment, it can expose system internals or sensitive data to the attackers.
Solution: Review the code to ensure no debug code or temporary test code is left in the production environment. Use logging carefully so as to not reveal sensitive system information.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode with all non-null fields

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullFields
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode generation when all the fields (author, isbn, title) are non-null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with non-null fields. Note down the expected hashcode according to the formula used in the method.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Compare the method's result with the expected hashcode.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the hashCode method provides the correct code when all fields are non-null. This is used to validate the quality of the hashing function, which is important for object comparisons and usage in data structures.

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode with all null fields

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNullFields
  Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode when all the fields are null. According to the implementation, the result should be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with all fields as null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Compare the method's result with 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the hashCode method provides the expected result when all fields are null. This is important for ensuring edge cases do not violate the contract of the hashCode method and ensure consistent behavior when used in data structures.

Scenario 3: Testing hashCode with some null and some non-null fields

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithSomeNullFields
  Description: This test verifies the hashCode generation when some (not all) fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object with some null and some non-null fields. Note down the expected hashcode according to the formula used in the method.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Compare the method's result with the expected hashcode.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the hashCode method provides the correct code when some fields are null. This verifies that the function can correctly handle mixed variables and ensures consistent object comparison behavior across the application.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-183: Permissive Content Security Policy Header
Issue: This preliminary analysis of the Java code reveals non-specific handling of HTTP response headers, potentially allowing browsers to load content from any origin. This may lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if malicious scripts are injected and executed from external sources.
Solution: Adopt a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the sources from which browsers can load content. Update response headers accordingly, ensuring browsers only load content from trusted and secure sources.

Vulnerability: CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation
Issue: The getter method 'getAuthor()' returns a reference to the private 'author' field potentially exposing fields that are private and are therefore not expected to be publicly accessible or modifiable outside the class. This might introduce the ability to bypass certain controls through object modification outside the trust boundary.
Solution: Implement the getter method to return a copy of the 'author', instead of a direct reference. This method keeps object state encapsulated within the instance and prevents unauthorized modification.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The provided code doesn't handle errors or exceptions, leading to a potential leak of sensitive information via stack traces or error messages.
Solution: Exceptions should be caught and handled in a way that protects sensitive information. Instead of displaying the entire exception, log the error and show a generic, user-friendly message.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check for normal functionality
Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorWorksCorrectly
  Description: This test is designed to confirm that the getAuthor method is functioning as expected and returns the correct author name when invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a class instance with a preset author name.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method on the class instance.
  Assert: Ensure that the return value equals the preset author name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor method works correctly and returns the expected author name. This is particularly significant in correctly identifying and obtaining the author details from classes instances.

Scenario 2: Test to validate return type
Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorReturnType
  Description: This test checks whether the return type of the getAuthor method is a string or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a known value to the author field.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method on the class instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an instance of the string class.
Validation: 
  This test validates the data type of the returned value by the getAuthor method. It's essential because it confirms that the getAuthor method always returns String as expected.

Scenario 3: Test to validate null author
Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorForNullValue
  Description: This test is to ensure that the getAuthor method returns null correctly when the author hasn't been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting an author value.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method on the class instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  This test is important to validate that the getAuthor method can handle null values correctly. For example, when an instance does not have a set author, it is expected that the method should return null, but not cause an error or exception.

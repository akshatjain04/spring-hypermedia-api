================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89:SQL Injection
Issue: The use of raw SQL parameters inputted directly from user input can lead to SQL injection attacks, where malicious SQL statements could be executed in the database.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM libraries, which support a parameterized interface that automatically escapes user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
Issue: Unsanitized user input that is rendered on a web page might lead to a Cross Site Scripting attack, where a malicious user can inject his own script that can steal session information or deface the website.
Solution: Ensure that the user input is always sanitized and properly escaped before it is being rendered on a website. Many modern web frameworks have XSS protection built-in, and it should be enabled.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify correct language is returned

Details:
  TestName: correctLanguageReturned
  Description: This test is designed to check if the "getLanguage" method correctly returns the set language.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a known value for the 'language' data.
  Act: Invoke the target method getLanguage() with the appropriate setup.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getLanguage method against the expected 'language' value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getLanguage method returns the correct value that was set for 'language'. The importance of this test is to ensure data integrity and proper functioning of the getter method.

Scenario 2: Test to handle null language values

Details:
  TestName: handleNullLanguageValues
  Description: This test is meant to check how the "getLanguage" method handles scenarios where the 'language' variable was not set or is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not define or set a value for the 'language' data.
  Act: Invoke the target method getLanguage() without setting 'language'.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if a null value is returned as the actual result from the getLanguage method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getLanguage method returns null when the 'language' data was not set. This test is important to ensure the method can handle null values gracefully without causing exceptions. 

Scenario 3: Test to handle empty language strings

Details: 
  TestName: handleEmptyLanguageString
  Description: This test is meant to determine how the "getLanguage" method reacts to scenarios where the 'language' data is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'language' data to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the target method getLanguage() with 'language' set to an empty string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an empty string is returned as the actual result from the getLanguage() method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getLanguage method returns an empty string when 'language' is set as an empty string. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method correctly handles and returns empty strings.

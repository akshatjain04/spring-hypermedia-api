================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)
Issue: If the `JsonIgnore` or other similar annotations from the Jackson library are not used judiciously, attackers can manipulate the deserialization process.
Solution: Avoid using Jackson (or other similar libraries) to deserialize untrusted data, apply `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` on model class or use `ObjectMapper` with `.ignoreUnknown()`.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: If not appropriately validated and sanitized, untrusted data used in SQL queries can expose the application to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Use Prepared Statements or Parameterized Queries, and apply ORM library's proprietary ways to avoid SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Information Exposure
Issue: Excessive or inappropriate exposure of sensitive information through `getSynopsis()`, can lead to information disclosure if not properly guarded.
Solution: Implement access control checks, encrypt sensitive data and minimize the data exposed via APIs or logs.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Retrieving The Synopsis Successfully
Details:  
    TestName: testRetrieveSynopsisSuccessfully
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getSynopsis method is returning the correct synopsis value when called. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the object and assign a synopsis to it.
    Act: Call the getSynopsis method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned synopsis against the originally assigned synopsis. 
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getSynopsis method works as expected and returns the assigned synopsis value. This is crucial to confirm there's no logical error in retrieving the synopsis from an object, as it impacts the further processing of the object data.

Scenario 2: Synopsis Value is Null
Details:  
    TestName: testSynopsisIsNull
    Description: This test is to verify that the getSynopsis method handles null input correctly.
  Execution:  
    Arrange: Create an object without assigning any synopsis to it (default value will be null).
    Act: Call the getSynopsis method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is null.
  Validation: 
    This validates that the getSynopsis method correctly handles the situation where a synopsis was not provided. It is important to check the handling of null values to avoid NullPointerException.

Scenario 3: Synopsis Contains Special Characters
Details:  
    TestName: testSynopsisWithSpecialCharacters
    Description: This test checks whether the getSynopsis method can correctly return a synopsis string that contains special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a string containing special characters to the synopsis of an object.
    Act: Call the getSynopsis method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is identical to the assigned value.
  Validation: 
    This validates the ability of the getSynopsis method to handle special characters, ensuring full functionality for any valid input.

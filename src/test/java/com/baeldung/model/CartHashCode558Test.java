ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_79c7740116
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_24d856d52f

  Scenario 1: Test hash code with null books and purchased as false

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullBooksAndNotPurchased
    Description: The test is meant to check the hash code returned when the books is null and purchased is false.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set books as null and purchased as false.
    Act: Invoke .hashCode() method.
    Assert: Assert if the calculated hash code equals to 1237.

  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when books is null and purchased is false, the returned hash code 1237 which
    is in line with the formula. This would confirm the correct implementation of the function.

  Scenario 2: Test hash code with null books and purchased as true

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullBooksAndPurchased
    Description: The test is meant to check the hash code returned when the books is null and purchased is true.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set books as null and purchased as true.
    Act: Invoke .hashCode() method.
    Assert: Assert if the calculated hash code equals to 1231.

  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when books is null and purchased is true, the hash code should be 1231 which
    validates the correct application of the formula and function's integrity.


  Scenario 3: Test hash code with non-null books and purchased as false

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithBooksAndNotPurchased
    Description: The test is meant to check the hash code returned when the books is not null and purchased is false.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set books as non-null ArrayList containing some book objects and purchased as false.
    Act: Invoke .hashCode() method.
    Assert: Assert if the calculated hash code equals to the result of the formula considering the hash code of books and purchased.

  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when the books is not null and purchased is false, the hash code generated according to the formula
    enables us to validate the correctness of the function's implementation.

  Scenario 4: Test hash code with non-null books and purchased as true

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithBooksAndPurchased
    Description: The test is meant to check the hash code returned when the books is not null and purchased is true.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set books as non-null ArrayList containing some book objects and purchased as true.
    Act: Invoke .hashCode() method.
    Assert: Assert if the calculated hash code equals to the result of the formula considering the hash code of books and purchased.

  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when the books is not null and purchased is true, the hash code is generated as per the formula
    successfully passing the test would confirm function's proper implementation.

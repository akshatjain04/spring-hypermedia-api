Scenario 1: Testing method with identical book objects
Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalBooks
Description: This test checks whether the method correctly identifies two identical book objects as equal.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two Book objects with the same author, isbn, and title.
Act: Call equals method, comparing the two book objects.
Assert: Check if the returned value is true.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the equals method works correctly when two identical book objects are compared. This is important to ensure that the method can properly identify identical entities.

Scenario 2: Testing method with different book objects
Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentBooks
Description: This test checks whether the method correctly identifies two different book objects as unequal.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two Book objects with different authors, isbns, or titles.
Act: Call equals method, comparing the two book objects.
Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the equals method works correctly when two different book objects are compared. This is crucial for the correct functionality of distinguishing different entities.

Scenario 3: Testing method where object compared is null
Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
Description: This test checks whether the method correctly identifies when the object compared is null.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Book object and a null object.
Act: Call equals method, comparing the Book with the null object.
Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the equals method properly identifies when the object compared is null. This is crucial to prevent NullPointerException from occurring.

Scenario 4: Testing method where objects are of different classes
Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClasses
Description: This test checks whether the method correctly identifies when objects are of different classes.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a Book object and an object of different class.
Act: Call equals method, comparing the Book object with the object of different class.
Assert: Check if the returned value is false. 
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when the objects are from different classes. This is important for ensuring proper type comparison in the application.

Scenario 5: Testing method with matching Books but different ISBNs
Details:
TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentISBNs
Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly identifies two books as different based on different ISBNs.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two Book objects with matching author and title but different ISBNs.
Act: Invoke equals() contrast the two book objects.
Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify the method's ability to differentiate between the two books based on ISBN, an important feature in the library system as books can have the same title and authors but differ in ISBN.

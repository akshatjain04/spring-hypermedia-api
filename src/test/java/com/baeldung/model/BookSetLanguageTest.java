================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The application uses user-provided data in an SQL statement without sanitation, which can lead to SQL Injection and allow an attacker to view, modify or delete data in the database.
Solution: Always use PreparedStatements to escape special characters and ensure user-provided data cannot modify the structure of SQL statements.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: When the application includes user-provided data in an HTML response without proper sanitation, attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.
Solution: Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in the HTML.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Sensitive information can be exposed through error messages or system information returned in a response. This can be exploited to gather more information about the system.
Solution: Always handle exceptions and errors by limiting information exposed and logging complete details for debugging.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross Site Request Forgery
Issue: Without proper anti-CSRF tokens in place, an attacker can trick the victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.
Solution: Always use anti-CSRF tokens and validate them for every state-changing request.

Scenario 1: Testing Language Assignment for null value

Details:  
TestName: checkNullLanguageAssignment
Description: This test is meant to check whether the setLanguage function shows proper behaviour when a null value is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
Arrange: No particular arrangement is required for this test case.
Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with null as the argument.
Assert: Assert that language value is null after the function invocation.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the language field of the object should be null after a null argument is passed in. This test confirms the expected behavior when null is passed as an argument to the method.

Scenario 2: Testing Language Assignment for empty string

Details:  
TestName: checkEmptyStringLanguageAssignment
Description: This test is meant to check whether the setLanguage function behaves expectedly when an empty string is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
Arrange: No particular arrangement is required for this test case.
Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with an empty string as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the language value is an empty string after the function invocation.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the language field of the object should be an empty string after an empty string is passed in. This test confirms the expected behavior when an empty string is passed as an argument to the setLanguage method.

Scenario 3: Testing Language Assignment for typical string value

Details:  
TestName: checkTypicalStringLanguageAssignment
Description: This test is meant to check whether the setLanguage function correctly assigns a typical String value to the language field.
Execution:
Arrange: No particular arrangement is required for this test case.
Act: Invoke the setLanguage method with a typical string (like "English") as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the language value is the same as the argument passed after the function invocation.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the language field of the object should be identical to the string argument passed in. This test confirms the expected behavior when a typical string is passed as an argument to the setLanguage method.

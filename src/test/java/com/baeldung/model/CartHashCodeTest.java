================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code snippet invokes hashCode() on 'books' which could be null leading to NullPointerException. Although NullPointerException isn't a security vulnerability by itself, unhandled exceptions can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) disrupting normal functioning of the application.
Solution: Always null check objects before invoking methods to avoid NullPointerException. Consider using Optional class in Java or null-safe access invocation.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The prime and result constants in the hashCode() method are not random enough, which might expose the system to risks if this function is used for security-critical computations.
Solution: If this hashCode() is used for anything related to security (like hashing passwords), it might not be secure enough. The prime number should preferably be a large, truly random prime, and the result should be hashed with a salt if used for critical computations.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test hashCode Method when books is null and purchased is false

    Details:  
      TestName: testHashcodeWhenBooksIsNullAndPurchasedFalse
      Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when "books" field is null and "purchased" field is false.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize the "books" field to null and "purchased" field to false.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is as expected when "books" is null and "purchased" is false.
    Validation: 
      This assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle null values for "books" and returns a consistent hashCode when "purchased" is false. This test ensures that the hashCode method is robust and can handle various scenarios.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode Method when books is null and purchased is true

    Details:  
      TestName: testHashcodeWhenBooksIsNullAndPurchasedTrue
      Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when "books" field is null and "purchased" field is true.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize the "books" field to null and "purchased" field to true.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is as expected when "books" is null and "purchased" is true.
    Validation: 
      This assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle null values for "books" and returns a consistent hashCode when "purchased" is true. This test ensures the correct functionality of the hashCode method under different conditions.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode Method when books is not null and purchased is false

    Details:  
      TestName: testHashcodeWhenBooksNotNullAndPurchasedFalse
      Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when "books" field is not null and "purchased" field is false. 
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize the "books" field to a non-null value and "purchased" field to false.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is as expected when "books" is not null and "purchased" is false.
    Validation: 
      The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method returns a consistent hashCode given a non-null "books" value and false "purchased" value. This validation ensures that the hashCode method works correctly for different input scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode Method when books is not null and purchased is true

    Details:  
      TestName: testHashcodeWhenBooksNotNullAndPurchasedTrue
      Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when "books" field is not null and "purchased" field is true.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize the "books" field to a non-null value and "purchased" field to true.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashCode is as expected when "books" is not null and "purchased" is true.
    Validation: 
      The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a consistent hashCode when given a non-null "books" value and true "purchased" value. This validation checks the correctness of the hashCode method under varying input conditions.

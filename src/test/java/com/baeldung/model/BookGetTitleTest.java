================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Omitted Class-Level Access Modifier
Issue: While omission of the access modifier implies package-private in Java, it can lead to unintended access by classes within the same package. This may expose sensitive data or operations.
Solution: Define your class accessibility explicitly to avoid unintended access. If the class is not to be externally available, define it as 'private'.

Vulnerability: Uninitialized Variables
Issue: The variable 'title' is not initialized, which may result in a NullPointerException if referenced before initialization.
Solution: If applicable, initialize your variables during declaration or in the class constructor to avoid NullPointerExceptions.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: If the 'title' field contains sensitive information, it's directly exposed via the getter method without any access control.
Solution: Apply proper access controls for sensitive data. This may involve verifying access permissions before returning sensitive information, or removing the getter entirely if the data should be kept private.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The 'setTitle' method (if exists) may not validate input, which can open your application to malicious inputs.
Solution: Add input validation to your 'setTitle' method, and any other methods that accept user input. This can involve verifying that the input matches expected formats and doesn't contain malicious code.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of title

  Details:  
    TestName: getTitleSuccessfully
    Description: Validates that the getTitle method returns the expected title. 
    The test targets a scenario where the title hasn't been modified after construction or set operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a known title. 
    Act: Call the getTitle method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title matches the known title.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the getTitle method correctly returns the title. 
    It is expected the returned title to be exactly the same as the initial set title. 
    The significance of this test is that it ensures the getter method is functioning accurately, thereby maintaining data integrity and correctness.

  Scenario 2: Handling of null title

  Details:  
    TestName: handleNullTitle
    Description: Tests the getTitle method's response when the title is null. 
    This targets the scenario where the title hasn't been initialized yet.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting a title.
    Act: Call the getTitle method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned title is null.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the getTitle method correctly deals with null titles, returning null as expected. 
    It is crucial to handle null gracefully to prevent NullPointerExceptions in the code that uses the getTitle method.

  Scenario 3: Handling of empty title

  Details:  
    TestName: handleEmptyTitle
    Description: Tests the getTitle method's dismissal of empty title or title with only whitespaces. 
    This targets the edge case scenario where an instance of the class assigned an empty title.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class giving it an empty title or title with only whitespaces.
    Act: Call the getTitle method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned title is an empty string or string with whitespaces.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that getTitle handles empty titles correctly & gracefully. 
    It's important to test such edge cases, as titles consisting only of whitespace might not be valid in the application's business context.

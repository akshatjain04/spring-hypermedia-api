================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inconsistent Error Handling
Issue: When your application presents detailed error messages (like stack traces), it may expose sensitive information. Attackers can use this information to exploit the vulnerability in the application.
Solution: Implement a global exception handler that catches all unhandled and unexpected exceptions. The handler should log the exception, and return a generic message to the user.

Vulnerability: Java injections
Issue: Sending untrusted data directly to an interpreter can result in injection attacks. For instance, SQL injection occurs when attackers can change the SQL query's structure, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences.
Solution: Applications should always validate and sanitize input, use parameterized queries or PDO when accessing the database, and use appropriate API functions whenever available.

"""
Scenario 1: Test setPurchased when input is true
Details:  
    TestName: setPurchasedTrue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setPurchased correctly updates the status when the input parameter is true. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to Arrange, as no dependent data or instances.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method with parameter as true. 
    Assert: Assert if the attribute purchased is updated to true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setPurchased method correctly sets the value of purchased attribute when input is true. This validation ensures correct behavior for purchasers setting purchase status.
 

Scenario 2: Test setPurchased when input is false
Details:  
    TestName: setPurchasedFalse
    Description: This test is meant to examine if the method setPurchased works properly when the input value is false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to Arrange, as no dependent data or instances.
    Act: Call the setPurchased method with false as input parameter. 
    Assert: Assert if the attribute purchased is updated to false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to ensure that the setPurchased method accurately sets the purchased attribute to false upon receiving this input. This test is vital for proper functionality when purchasers are resetting their purchase status.

Scenario 3: Test setPurchased multiple times
Details:  
    TestName: setPurchasedMultipleTimes
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setPurchased correctly handles multiple invocation of the method with different input values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to Arrange, as no dependent data or instances.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method multiple times with different inputs (both true and false). 
    Assert: Assert if the attribute purchased is updated correctly each time the method is invoked.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setPurchased method updates the purchased attribute correctly with every invocation, not just the first. This validation checks the integrity of the assignment process and the independence of method invocations.
